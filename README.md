An example of a command-line application for calculating directly proportional quantities, a method known as the "rule of three"...

In mathematics, specifically elementary arithmetic and elementary algebra, given an equation between two fractions or rational expressions, you can cross-multiply the equation to simplify the equation or determine the value of a variable.

The method is also occasionally known in Portuguese as the "rule of 3" as or the "cross your heart" method because lines similar to a heart outline can be drawn to remember what things to multiply.

In the main function there are 5 calls to the calc function with different arguments to determine the value of the null variable, we also have two more tests including incorrect numbers of null variables...
